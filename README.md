<font size = 8>**<u> Start-up, shear-driven flow of a Oldroyd-B fluid between parallel plates**<u></font>

&emsp; This program solves the following system of equations:

$$ Re \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial \tau}{\partial x} $$

and

$$ Wi \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \
        - \tau + \beta \frac{Wi}{Re} \frac{\partial^2 \tau}{\partial x^2}, $$

where $\tau$ and $u$ are the local shear stress and fluid velocity, respectively. The Reynolds number $Re$ , the Wiessenberg number $Wi$, and the viscosity ratio $\beta$ are defined according to

$$ Re = \frac{\rho U h}{\eta} , $$

$$ Wi = \lambda \frac{U}{h}, $$

and

$$ \beta = \frac{\eta_s}{\eta} .$$

Here $\eta$, $\eta_s$, $\rho$, $U$, $h$, and $\lambda$ are the solution viscosity, solvent visocosity, density, upper plate velocity, gap width, and viscoelastic relaxation time, respectively, and the time scale $\bar t$ for this problem is defined by the characteristic shear rate according to $\bar t = \frac{h}{U}$. The boundary conditions are no flux (stress) and no slip (velocity) at $x = 0$ and $x = 1$ with uniform initial condtions.

&emsp; In order to view the influence of elasticity in this problem, it is useful to define the elasticity number $E$, given by

$$ E = \frac{Wi}{Re} = \frac{\lambda}{t_{diff}} ,$$
    
which is the ratio of the viscoelastic relaxation time scale $\lambda$ over the momentum diffusion time scale $t_{diff} = \frac{h^2}{\nu}$, where $\nu = \frac{\eta}{\rho}$ is the kinematic viscosity. 

> In this problem, momentum transfer across the gap occurs via two mechanisms: 1) diffusion and 2) shear wave propagation. The value of $E$ indicates the relative importance of these mechanisms.
    
<font size = 3>**<u> Limits:**<u></font>

&emsp; In the limit $E<<1$, viscoelastic relaxation is very fast on the time scale $t_{diff}$ and elasticity effects are negligible. Here, momentum spreads through the fluid via diffusion in response to an imposed shear stress at the wall and eqn (2) reduces to: $\tau = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$, corresponding to a Newtonian fluid. In this limit, the conservation equations are parabolic.
    
Alternatively, in the limit $E >> 1$, viscoelastic relaxation is very slow on the time scale $t_{diff}$ and the fluid behaves as an elastic solid. Here, momentum spreads through the fluid via a shear wave in response to a shear stress at the wall. In this case, the conservation equations are hyperbolic.

<font size = 3>**<u> Numerical Scheme:**<u></font>

The problem above is a *linear* system of hyperbolic equations of the form:
$$ \frac{\partial \boldsymbol q}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol A \cdot \frac{\partial \boldsymbol q}{\partial x} =  \boldsymbol\psi $$ 
where 
$$ \boldsymbol q = \begin{bmatrix} u 
                                \\\ \tau 
                                \end{bmatrix}, $$
